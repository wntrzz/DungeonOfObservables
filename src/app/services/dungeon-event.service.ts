  //
  // = new Subject<string>(): This creates the hub itself.  It's not just a single stone, but the
  // whole system, including the magic that powers it and the person controlling it.
  //
  // Subject (Observable + manual control):
  //   - Observable: The magical connection that allows attuned Sending Stones to receive messages.
  //     It's like a magical radio wave that anyone with the right receiver can tune into. Adventurers
  //     all over the realm can "observe" (listen to) messages sent by the hub.
  //   - Manual Control: A powerful wizard or cleric at the hub decides *what* messages are sent
  //     (warnings, quest updates, news) and *when* they're sent. They're not just a passive transmitter;
  //     they actively choose the content. They can announce a dragon sighting, give details about a
  //     new quest, or warn about an approaching army.  They're in control of the broadcast.
  //
  // <string>: Specifies that the messages sent will be in the form of written scrolls containing text.
  // Imagine the wizard writing messages on parchment.
  //
  // In short: eventSubject is like the Sending Stone hub. It broadcasts messages (Observable) that
  // anyone with an attuned stone can receive, but a person (like the wizard) is actively in charge,
  // choosing what's broadcast and when (manual control). It's not just random magic; it's curated
  // information. Just like a Subject in code allows you to send data to multiple listeners, but
  // you have the power to decide what that data is and when it is sent.
