      The Dungeon Log acts as the party‚Äôs journal, recording significant events as they unfold in the adventure.
      Just as a Dungeon Master (DM) keeps track of encounters, discoveries, and critical moments, this component listens
      to the DungeonMasterService and logs each event for reference.
      The Dungeon Log subscribes to the DungeonMasterService‚Äôs event stream, ensuring that every battle, treasure find,
      and ominous tremor is documented. This allows adventurers to reflect on past events and strategize their next moves.

      In the PartyAnnouncementComponent, the DungeonMasterService acts as the storyteller, weaving the tale of the dungeon adventure.
      Events in the story are managed using observables, which allow the component to asynchronously listen to the ongoing narrative.
      When the component is initialized, it subscribes to the observable provided by the getEvents() method of DungeonMasterService.
      This subscription acts as the adventurers' readiness to respond to the unfolding story. As each new event‚Äîbe it a dragon attack,
      treasure discovery, or mysterious door opening‚Äîis emitted, the component reacts by processing and displaying an announcement.
      The subscription starts the flow of events, and the component will continue to react to these updates until it unsubscribes,
      ensuring it doesn't continue listening when it‚Äôs no longer needed.
